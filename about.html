        Hi! I'm Audrey, an aspiring music producer and sound designer. I enjoy making
      dance/pop/electronic music with and for other artists. Aside from music production,
      I've also gained significant interest in sound design elements for video games.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        When I'm not working with sound design and music, I spend a lot of time appreciating
      fashion design and touching up on my sewing skills, as well as doing fun graphic makeup.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        My goal is to continue to work and collaborate with more artists and producers, and
      to make music with/for other people. Aside from music production, I'd like to gain more
      experience with video game sound design and work on my audio implementation skills.
      Over the last year or so I've really come to enjoy collaborative environments and
      gaining insight into the various perspectives that are present with whatever project is
      being worked on.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I love working with new people and challenging myself to explore different genres of
      music as well as techniques for production. If you're interested in working together,
      please feel free to contact me using my contact page!
