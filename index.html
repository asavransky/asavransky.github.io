  <p>Here is where some cute info about my work will go in addition to the MP3
    files for the two songs that are almost finished, and the video that pairs
    with for my EP-491. Any actual info about myself is in a seperate doc atm
    for the sake of organization and getting format/layout over content until
    things are set up the way i like !!
