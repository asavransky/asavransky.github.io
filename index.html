  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Audrey Savransky is currently in their last year at Berklee College of Music,
  completing a Bachelor of Music in Electronic Production and Design, with a specialization
  in Sound Design for Video Games. Audrey began experimenting with music production in her
  second semester at Berklee and instantly felt gravitated to the EPD major. After
  four years in attendance, Audrey plans to begin releasing projects that she had worked on
  during her final semester.
  </p>
  <p> In addition, Audrey has been a dedicated performer and instrumentalist since
  2007, performing at various private parties, local summers festivals, and events
  at significant venues such as the Rock 'N Roll Hall of Fame. While music production
  has been their main focus, she still performs with friends bands at the occasional
  Allston house show.
