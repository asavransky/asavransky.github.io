        "Nobody" is one of two singles that I produced this semester for my
        EP-491 course (also known as a capstone project). This song was a
        collaborative effort between myself and Nikole Ortega, the vocalist
        featured on the track. We spent the entire course of the semester
        having various recording sessions and meetings to ensure that the
        final product was something that we were both happy with. This track
        wouldn't have been a complete success without the help of Omisha
        Chaitanya, who helped graciously with mixing and assisting with
        recording sessions. Thank you to both Niko and Omi for all of your
        hard work!

        Here is where some cute info about my work will go in addition to the MP3
        files for the two songs that are almost finished, and the video that pairs
        with for my EP-491. Any actual info about myself is in a seperate doc atm
        for the sake of organization and getting format/layout over content until
        things are set up the way i like !!
