        "Nobody" is one of two singles that I produced this semester for my
        EP-491 course (also known as a capstone project). This song was a
        collaborative effort between myself and Nikole Ortega, the song writer
        and vocalist featured on the track. We spent the entire course of the
        semester having various recording sessions and meetings to ensure that
        the final product was something that we were both happy with.

        This track wouldn't have been a complete success without the help of
        Omisha Chaitanya, who helped graciously with mixing and assisting with
        recording sessions. Thank you to both Niko and Omi for all of your
        hard work!

        "One V One" is the second single produced as a part of my capstone
        project for EP-491. Similarly to "Nobody", this song was a collaboration
        with my dear friend, Akira Oni over the same timeline. Akira assisted
        with production and song writing. In addition to the song itself, we
        worked with their partner, James Paolicelli to create a music video to
        go with.

        We used full body tracking in VR to track our live in person
        motion with customized avatars, used in game cameras to record varioius
        clips and then edited them together to create an iconic video for an
        iconic song for the girls and gays. Huge thanks to both Akira and
        James for all your help and creativity!
