# Site Building Process
my initial attempt to get information on the site was incredibly tragic,
after some re-evaluation I was able to make a basic set up in the index.html file.

## site plan
the plan is to have a few different pages that you can switch between. One about me, a contact page, and the actual portfolio. I think that the about me is more of my format testing point and the other pages will come after i get a better grasp on the relationship between HTML and css
