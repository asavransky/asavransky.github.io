# TLDR;
damn this was a bitch to make. lots of thoughtless and redundant errors.

# Site Building Process
my initial attempt to get information on the site was incredibly tragic,
after some re-evaluation I was able to make a basic set up in the index.html file.
Once the index was working the way I wanted, I added the CSS and began to add more site elements
and spent more time with the CSS.

## site plan
the plan is to have a few different pages that you can switch between. One about me, a contact page, and the actual portfolio. I think that the about me is more of my format testing point and the other pages will come after i get a better grasp on the relationship between HTML and css

## issues as they come!
CSS formatting is a bit of an issue. I'm not sure if my actual css file is working or not at the moment but i think im gonna make some drastic changes to make sure that I have it set up right?? tbd.

Image:
I was able to upload an image!! however its wayyy too big at the moment and i want it to sit pretty small on the left hand side and have the text on the right. I think this goes hand and hand with the CSS file mentioned above.

Audio:
Ok so i was able to add one audio source/mp3 to the page which is iconic, however i'm trying to get two or more on
there!! Just for the sake of content on the site.

Layout:
So i went through the CSS reference i'm using and adjusted some of the layout, but i cant quite get things to sit where i want and my CSS file is starting to get confusing and very disorganized. need to come back to that with a better method of organization

After fixing the external pages issue I am now having layout issues!! sooo slayyy!!! I lost the header somehow??
i'm not really sure how that happened but I think im gonna have to go through the style.css and reorganize. I
don't really remember what is what and thats a big oopsie on my behalf lol.

Maybe some of my layout issues are on behalf of the fact that there's quite literally no rhyme or reason to the way that i'm inputting stuff? like its all just in there chaotically

CSS files and external pages:
I have .html for the external pages !! do i need separate folders with their own index.html files in them??
**update - literally just a typo error. had an extra html note in the code lol**

## organization
bro fuck organizing this LMAOOO why is it so difficult??? ur telling me that now bc i put everything in folders it's all gotta have new paths!!! rookie mistake on my end. i should've embraced the chaos.

## sub-pages

i used this reference to help figure out how to add multiple pages to the site, it does a really good job of breaking down how to organize different pages.
