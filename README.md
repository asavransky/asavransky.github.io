# TLDR;
damn this was a bitch to make. lots of thoughtless and redundant errors.

# Site Building Process
my initial attempt to get information on the site was incredibly tragic,
after some re-evaluation I was able to make a basic set up in the index.html file.
Once the index was working the way I wanted, I added the CSS and began to add more site elements
and spent more time with the CSS.

## site plan
the plan is to have a few different pages that you can switch between. One about me, a contact page, and the actual portfolio. I think that the about me is more of my format testing point and the other pages will come after i get a better grasp on the relationship between HTML and css

## issues as they come!
- CSS formatting is a bit of an issue. I'm not sure if my actual css file is working or not at the moment but i think im gonna make some drastic changes to make sure that I have it set up right?? tbd.

**Images:**
- I was able to upload an image!! however its wayyy too big at the moment and i want it to sit pretty small on the left hand side and have the text on the right. I think this goes hand and hand with the CSS file mentioned above.
- Figuring out proper picture sizing took a little bit of time and figuring out pixel sizes, however I did it!
- WHY WONT THIS PICTURE FLOAT CENTER !!!! LIKE>?? the code is literally telling it what to do and the image is literally just deciding to do its own thing. like thats really rude???? like just center yourself???
- i think i need another break :)
- images are all good now :)

**Audio:**
- Ok so i was able to add one audio source/mp3 to the page which is iconic, however i'm trying to get two or more on
there!! Just for the sake of content on the site.
- update: this was also a typo error. literally so annoying lmao.
- No problems with audio after this.

**Video**
- at this current point in time i do not have the final video that will be put on the website but i do plan to have a video!! hoping that it'll be ready before class so I can pop it in as my main demonstration.
- Planning to do video implementation and then full screen perhaps??? we'll see.

**Layout:**
- So i went through the CSS reference i'm using and adjusted some of the layout, but i cant quite get things to sit where i want and my CSS file is starting to get confusing and very disorganized. need to come back to that with a better method of organization
- After fixing the external pages issue I am now having layout issues!! sooo slayyy!!! I lost the header somehow??
i'm not really sure how that happened but I think im gonna have to go through the style.css and reorganize. I
don't really remember what is what and thats a big oopsie on my behalf lol.
- Maybe some of my layout issues are on behalf of the fact that there's quite literally no rhyme or reason to the way that i'm inputting stuff? like its all just in there chaotically
- now that i have the audio and some info related to the audio on the site i realize that im gonna need the images/
the text in columns so that they can exist side by side.
- you know. I finally got the website looking pretty nice and then BOOM, i got cocky and am back at square one with the layout. this is so annoying i could scream.
- the columns are literally causing so many problems. if something is specified as left column, then why is it being put onto the right/!!?!??!??!? like make it make sense??? also, the padding for it got all shitty and weird. i feel like i got soooo much done just for this to happen, i think now is a good time to take a break :)
- I feel like i have been going in circles for hours to try and get things to literally just sit side by side from one another and it simply is not working the way that i want to. it's a littttleeee frustrating that I can't get it despite going through things a million times but whatever.
- ok. I took a much needed break. I feel like its finally starting to look the way that i want it to but im not sure what changed that all of the sudden everything is working. i feel like im getting the hang of how it needs to be set up but i dont want to be too sure???
- rather than making a bunch of big changes all at once and pushing them, i am quite literally making one or two adjustments at a time and then pushing it to make sure i dont fuck it up lmaoooo.
- this is literally so tedious. i keep making the smallest teeniest mistakes
- ^realized i never specified what this was about. literally all of it was about columns and column adjustments/spacing.
- Breaks are so important. Things are finally set up relatively as they should be! It's not 100% what I was envisioning but I'm happy with where it is and glad I figured it out.

**CSS files and external pages:**
- I have .html for the external pages !! do i need separate folders with their own index.html files in them??
- **update - literally just a typo error. had an extra html note in the code lol**
- i used my third reference to help figure out how to add multiple pages to the site, it does a really good job of breaking down how to organize different pages.
- ok so i started working on the about me and the css for that as well. I'm using this as the test page before really messing with the layout of the home page so that I can get kind of a clear idea as to what i'm trying to do. right now i'm trying to make columns for my written info and so my images can sit next to it. I also need the navigation bar at the top so there's consistency with the site and so that you can freely navigate through the pages.
- i was able to get the contact page fairly easily with the help of one of my references
- the about me page was a bit of a struggle. I had two separate columns, i just couldnt get them to sit next to each other vs making rows. I adjusted by making one column, the top row being for two images and the bottom for the actual about me information.

**Organization**
- bro fuck organizing this LMAOOO why is it so difficult??? ur telling me that now bc i put everything in folders it's all gotta have new paths!!! rookie mistake on my end. i should've embraced the chaos.
- *i got rid of the folders. chaos it is.*
- i'm realizing that my css for the index is soooo awful. i have no idea what is what. i'm probably just going to use the about css as a template for it since it's much more organized and then make adjustments to fit the home page.
- I ended up just doing some cleanup, getting rid of things I initially didn't label and redoing it. Even though it was tedious, it was the best decision in the long run since it was a refresher to what I was actually adding, and it gave me the opportunity to put in little notes to remind me of what each section was for.
- this isn't an organization issue but just a complaint, why is html so hard on the eyes? I've missed so many little mistakes simply because it's just hard to look at for an extensive period of time.

# FINAL THOUGHTS AND OVERVIEW
Jesus christ was this one of the most tedious things I have done in a minute. All of the things I thought that I would end up having a problem with ended up being the parts that were easy, and all of the things that I thought would be easy and straightforward were absolute nightmares trying to figure out. The fact that in just one day I had over 180 commits is insane to me. Even though I'm finishing my site the morning of (with the exception that I'm waiting to receive a video), I feel really glad that I didn't put it off as long as I probably would've with any other final project.

Thankfully, HTML is not as scary as I was expecting it to be. If the language had been even just an ounce of confusing I think I would've been screwed, but lets focus on the bright side: it isn't so I was not screwed!!! I will say, I'm proud of myself for getting it all set up even if its not the most professional looking site. Things to note for the future would be as follows:

- CSS templates exist. Probably would've made things easier/nicer
- organization is SO important early on
- breaks are also important, small errors sneak past with tired eyes
- This takes so much more time than you anticipate
- I am not patient enough to make anything more complex than what I just did
