# Site Building Process
my initial attempt to get information on the site was incredibly tragic,
after some re-evaluation I was able to make a basic set up in the index.html file.

## site plan
the plan is to have a few different pages that you can switch between. One about me, a contact page, and the actual portfolio. I think that the about me is more of my format testing point and the other pages will come after i get a better grasp on the relationship between HTML and css

## issues as they come!
CSS formatting is a bit of an issue. I'm not sure if my actual css file is working or not at the moment but i think im gonna make some drastic changes to make sure that I have it set up right?? tbd.

I was able to upload an image!! however its wayyy too big at the moment and i want it to sit pretty small on the left hand side and have the text on the right. I think this goes hand and hand with the CSS file mentioned above.

## sub-pages

i used this reference to help figure out how to add multiple pages to the site, it does a really good job of breaking down how to organize different pages.
